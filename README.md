# Earthquake_Prediction
This Repo is created to discuss ideas on how earthquake can be prevented by the use of Technology. Code Fun Do!

## Concept
* The ground water level is known to vary drastically just before an Earthquake. Both cases are possible : ``` Rise in Water Level ``` or ``` Fall in Water level ``` . The reason behind this is that when an earthquake is about to happen, the rocks already have started moving a few days ago. Lets say there is a water body in a region where earthquake is about to happen. The seismic rocks below the water body might move up on colliding with some other rock. In this case the water level rises. The water level might drop in multiple ways. If the rock below the water is moved down, the water level falls. Earthquake might also lead to crack in rocks and so water might seep into those cracks and lower the water level

Example of water level change before an earthquake!

* Another thing often noticed is that the mineral contents of the water bodies change before an earthquake. This can be used as a measure to predict earthquake.

## Solution
* Water level measuring meter can be used to keep a track of ground water level. Submersible Pressure Transducer can be used to monitor water pressure. Past data can be fed as data set to ML and data from our devices can be analysed continuously. (More info in subsequent commits.)
* If change in mineral is also being tracked, that too can be combined with the above data and generate even more accurate reports. (More info in subsequent commits.)

### Adding Other Dimensions
* Animal behaviour often gets unusual before an earthquake. Though this is not a part of the original solution, this is also a possibility that may help to improve predictions. Observing animals, their movement, etc. can be used as data to input the ML.
